# 🧬 Derma-Semantics Pro: Explainable Medical AI

**A Specialized Multimodal System for Dermatological Diagnosis**

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Derma-Semantics Pro** is an advanced AI diagnostic tool designed to bridge the gap between "Black Box" deep learning and clinical interpretability.

Unlike traditional CNNs that simply output a label (e.g., "Melanoma"), this system utilizes **BioMedCLIP**, a Vision-Language foundation model. By fine-tuning both the visual and textual encoders using **Contrastive Learning**, the model learns the *semantic definition* of skin diseases, allowing for:

1. **Zero-Shot Classification** of 7 distinct skin conditions.
2. **Visual Explainability (X-Ray)** via gradient-based saliency mapping.
3. **Bias Mitigation** through strategic dataset balancing and augmentation.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The system moves beyond standard Transfer Learning by employing a **Dual-Tower Contrastive Fine-Tuning** strategy.

### 1. Foundation Model: BioMedCLIP (Microsoft)

I utilize `microsoft/BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT_256-vit_base_patch16_224`, pre-trained on 15 million biomedical image-text pairs. This provides a robust starting point for understanding medical visual syntax.

### 2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

To specialize the model without catastrophic forgetting (or massive compute costs), we inject **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** adapters into the Vision Transformer (ViT):

* **Rank (r):** 32
* **Alpha:** 64
* **Target Modules:** `qkv`, `proj`, `fc1`, `fc2` (All linear layers)
* **Trainable Params:** < 1% of total parameters.

### 3. Contrastive Training Objective

Instead of a simple Cross-Entropy classification head, I optimize the **InfoNCE Loss** (CLIP Loss). The model is trained to maximize the cosine similarity between:

* **Image:** A dermoscopy photo of a lesion.
* **Text:** The specific medical definition (e.g., *"High risk melanoma skin cancer"*).

## 📊 Dataset & Optimization

**Source:** [ISIC-2018](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/) (via `marmal88/skin_cancer`)

### The "Class Imbalance" Challenge

The raw dataset is heavily biased toward common benign moles (Nevi), creating a "lazy" model that ignores rare cancers.

| Condition | Original Count | Action Taken |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Melanocytic Nevi** | **6,405** (Dominant) | 📉 **Downsampled to 1,500** |
| **Melanoma** | 1,076 | ✅ Kept 100% |
| **Basal Cell Carcinoma** | 487 | ✅ Kept 100% |
| **Actinic Keratosis** | 315 | ✅ Kept 100% |
| **Dermatofibroma** | 110 (Rare) | 🔄 **Heavy Augmentation** |

**Preprocessing Strategy:**

* **Strategic Undersampling:** Removed 75% of the majority class to force the model to learn cancer features.
* **Dynamic Augmentation:** Applied `RandomResizedCrop`, `Rotation`, and `ColorJitter` to prevent overfitting on the minority classes.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Class Semantic Profiling

The model compares the patient's image against the text descriptions of 7 different conditions (Melanoma, BCC, Nevi, etc.) and generates a confidence distribution. This aligns with how dermatologists think (differential diagnosis).

### 2. Dynamic X-Ray Vision (Saliency Maps)

Users can ask the AI *"Show me signs of Melanoma"* vs *"Show me signs of Keratosis"*. The system uses backpropagation to highlight the exact pixels that align with the requested text description.

### 3. Safety-First Triage

The application flags "High Risk" malignancies (Melanoma, BCC) with distinct alerts, prioritizing sensitivity (Recall) to ensure dangerous lesions are not missed.

## 💻 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* NVIDIA GPU (Recommended for Inference)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuaibu-shehu/derma-semantics-pro.git
cd derma-semantics-pro
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### 2 Download  finetuned weights
**Download From:** [Derma Semantics Pro Weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lXadQ97rtxlU7NkHxWk6HlYNqztVCHd2/view)
* Ensure _weights_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/biomedclip_contrastive_finetuned.pt"_ points to the downloaded weights path

### 3. Run the App

The interface is built with **Streamlit** for rapid clinical prototyping.

```bash
streamlit run app.py

```

## 📈 Performance Results (Fine-tuning is ongoing, aiming for higher Accuracy).

* **Zero-Shot Test Accuracy:** **~81.71%**
* *Note:* This metric represents the model's ability to correctly identify the disease purely by matching the image to its text description, without a traditional classifier head.


* **Sensitivity (Recall) for Melanoma:** Optimized to **>85%** in validation studies to prioritize patient safety.
